# Polarisation Switch Control System
Control polarisation for Wimo X-Quads using an Arduino Uno and a 8-Channel Relay Module. 
Forked from Peter (2M0SQL) - https://github.com/magicbug/polarisation-switch

This code runs on my Raspberry Pi hosting a ser2net server for my Spid RAS Rotator and Cloudlog (https://github.com/magicbug/Cloudlog).
It should also run connecting the Arduino to a Linux, Mac or Windows PC with a Python enviroment (Not tested yet). It is just comfortable for my situation.

Running a 8-Channel Relay Module you'll have:

## Polarisation Options for a VHF and UHF X-Quad
* Horizontal 
* Vertical
* RHCP
* LHCP
## The two left relays maybe used for an Antenna 2 by 2 switch (will add that later to the code)
